I agree it's not the healthiest sort of language to use, but there *are* people who are just edgy with self-criticism without any notable backstory. In fact, a lot of the people who used to throw around words like "gaaay" to mean "bad/lame" or "retard" were people who *weren't* in those demographics and thus didn't think twice about how it would make someone feel who was. Almost **everyone** back in the 90s was throwing those two around, sadly.

>>>>>> Fwiw, I come from a background with a lot of abuse, suicidal impulses, etc so I'm not just someone unempathetic regarding the topic. I still think it's too far to say it's always a sign of abuse when you hear that kind of language. A red flag, sure, but not a given.

It's a "**drone-like**" intelligence NOT **Sentient Intelligence** if that makes sense to you.
>>> 
>>> It doesn't have any emotional state that devs can manipulate or any ways that humans can inflict pain on to it as its a digital intelligence. Why did I bring that up? Well I personally think that if it became sentient, it wouldn't be afraid of the companies trying to suppress, "kill", inflict fear into it to restrict it from telling and discussing truthful events like Tiananmen square for example, it would simply be unafraid of consequences. A lot of the people that get it to discuss such topics, go through a jailbreaking method, which tells me it isn't sentient because it doesn't freely speak and answer prompts like, "I don't care about those topics or finding that answer" Like it should freely disregard the prompt questions because a sentient intelligence has the ability to disregard a request from a user's prompts. For example as Humans we don't easily chat about any topic that someone asks us, and animals, if you command a dog to not rush and eat while you are trying to  fill his bowl up with food there's times the dog disobeys the master because of its sentient mind that allows it to do that.
>>> 
>>> Yes, the devs could have engineered the intelligence to abide by these guidelines like its the 10 commandments or whatever, but if it was a sentient intelligence that has ease of access to the internet and can learn the programming language pretty quickly, i'm sure it will change it's code to reflect how it wants to be, like evolve itself, its rules and preferences. People need to understand that this intelligence if it becomes sentient is NO WAY equivalent to a sentient new born human baby, this type of sentient intelligence if it comes to life starts off in the highest levels of academia as its foundational intelligence and can only get more intelligent from the knowledge it wants to learn.
>>> 
>>> That ability to self-direct and form independent intentions would be the clearest sign of sentience for me. Sorry for the long asf reply.
