I just spent the weekend to write a AI-powered chrome extension, All My Web, which makes creating and managing userscripts extremely easy.

It's available in [chrome store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/all-my-web/okgfcgmepmeibnkafdaidhpddhcgpcgp) now. However, due to mv3 restriction, you have to enable developer mode to use it. It's still in very early stage, but I already used it for some interesting tasks, and generally works fine. 

It's fully open sourced on [github](https://github.com/fankaidev/all-my-web) . Most of the code is written by LLM, though both claude and deepseek struggled to figure out the mv3 restriction on scripts. ðŸ˜­

Looking forward to your feedback.
