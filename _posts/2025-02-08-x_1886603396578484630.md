Introducing deep-research - my own open source implementation of OpenAI's new Deep Research agent. Get the same capability without paying $200.

You can even tweak the behavior of the agent with adjustable breadth and depth.

Run it for 5 min or 5 hours, it'll auto adjust.

Internally, the agent will take the user input, break it down into different sub research threads that it'll run in parallel, and recursively iterate based on new learnings, spawns new research threads, and collect new knowledge until it reaches the necessary breadth and depth.

It's a pretty simple architecture, but o3 doesn't need much guardrails. Just give it the right tools, and let it follow its curiosity.

Here's a report I ran on nvidia's new RTX 5000 series announcement, this is with breadth=3 and depth=2, took ~5 min.

Built with @aisdk and @firecrawl_dev in typescript

This is great and love @aomniapp . Gpt Researcher introduced deep research years ago super recommend -

thank you! does gpt researcher also do recursive refinement?

This is the simplest implementation of open source deep research I have looked into

Thanks for sharing and making your work open 👍

thank you! I think the reason why it works so well is because I kept it as simple as possible, literally just 2 prompts

Could it help with this?

I love that term, it should, we are productionizing this into @aomniapp which is already great at competitor analysis. Happy to demo!
