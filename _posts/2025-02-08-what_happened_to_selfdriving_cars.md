**hn-mc** - 2025-02-08T08:11:17.000Z

Sometime in mid to late 2010s, I was convinced that by 2025 self-driving cars would be commonplace.

Google trends also reflect that. Seems like around 2018, we had the peak of the hype.

Nowadays, hardly anyone mentions them, and they are still far from being widely adopted.

There's just a seemingly infinite amount of weird crap that can happen thay will screw the self driving up. For exame, one vehicle got into an accident when someone had a mirror on their vehicle and it screwed with the cameras and sensors. Another time there was a flat bed truck infront of the vehicle that was transporting traffic lights and it basically confused the hell out of the driving and made it go haywire. Now, take every scenario and add bad weather, or good weather, or night, and day,coupled with ice, or no ice... there's too much that can go wrong or unexpected.

> I think in some countries with good modern road systems they’re already quite widely used. In the UK where I live the roads are frequently quite narrow and complicated, reflecting dev over 100s of years. Some have been routes developed by the Romans and are still known as ‘Roman Roads’. I can’t see self driving cars managing a lot of UK roads (although ironically Roman roads can be identified on maps because they are very straight). Probably self driving vehicles will be used on large business and university campuses and probably on motorway systems.

In most cases a taxi ride is a discretionary service for entertainment purposes or for tourists. (Leaving aside unexpected hospital dashes or rare breakdowns of a main vehicle, I know there are always exceptions). But with the economy collapsing for the middle and lower class, spending money to go out to dinner or a bar and drink is a frivolous luxury. One and restaurants are already having to prove above what the old mass market could bare. So the ability to drive mass consumption of self driving taxis is hard. The rich could afford it, but there’s only so many taxi rides a person can take in a day, no matter how wealthy they are.

They are not and will never be perfect, but at some point we will switch our comparison  with the current generation not wanting to drive and the massive growth in other countries (China), I think this switch is already happening. The "snow problem" is real but we could have wide adoption of self driving cars that were limited in where and which conditions they could drive in.
> 2) regulatory and liability questions.  When there is a human driver liability is clear and able to be spread. Once you say you are level 5 then the liability must go onto the car company. We also have very high bars to cross to allow self driving cars into areas and govt and unions protecting professional drivers. This is likely to change with the new administration.

If we see a zebra on the street we know it's a wild animal and it's probably scared shitless and people with tranquilizer guns are probably taking aim at that very moment because it escaped somewhere. We would not mistake that for a common horse with rider and try to maneuver around it, we would stay clear and back up as best we could.

Construction work, delivery guys, kids playing games, weather conditions, ... we often extrapolate from our knowledge of the world to predict how things will turn out. That's yet not possible for a locally ran AI system, maybe in time and as AI systems advance, but we do need some sort of general AI to tackle the problem.

Self driving isn't federally legal in the US or most of Europe, though many states have implemented their own laws that permit it under certain specific scenarios.  But it's not viable for a car company to spend money developing the technology when it might not be sellable in some countries and states, and it's not likely to become legal until there's a lot of testing and demand for it, and it ends up in this weird catch 22
> 
> And most people are very against the idea of self driving cars, convinced they can drive better, even when the evidence suggests that they almost certainly can't - but nobody thinks they're the average person.  You'd be hard pressed to even get enough public support to make them legal, let alone profit from selling them
> 
> Tesla put in a lot of time and money into publicizing the idea for a while, and made good progress, but the few failures went viral and did more harm than good.  And overall, they made the mistake of relying on regular cameras, but LIDAR is kinda the more obvious way forward, which is what all of the actually successful self-driving companies like Waymo use.  In the end, it seems that this isn't something a car company would ever produce, because it doesn't sell cars - but it's great for a company that's just selling transportation, instead
